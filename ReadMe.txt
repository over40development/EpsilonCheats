    Xbox 360 APPLICATION : NativeDLL Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this NativeDLL application for you.  

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your NativeDLL application.

NativeDLL.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

NativeDLL.cpp
    This is the main application source file.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named NativeDLL.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" comments to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.
